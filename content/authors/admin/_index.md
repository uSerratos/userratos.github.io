PhD-educated Data Scientist specializing in applying advanced machine learning and statistical analysis to complex time-series and physiological data. Possesses over five years of hands-on experience building robust data pipelines in Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch) and SQL. Expert in the full data science workflow, including data curation, advanced feature engineering, dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP), and developing hybrid models. A key project involved using unsupervised clustering (HDBSCAN) to discover novel features ("syllables of movement") from raw data, which then powered a highly accurate Random Forest classifier to predict complex human behaviours.
