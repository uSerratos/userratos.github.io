Human movement and data science researcher with expertise in machine learning, action classification, motion tracking, and human motion modelling. My doctoral research established a novel framework for quantifying upper limb dexterity, integrating manipulability, workspace, and range of motion analysis. Currently, I apply immersive virtual reality and advanced machine learning techniques to dissect the fundamental components of human threat avoidance behaviour. My work involves developing an unsupervised clustering model to identify fundamental movement motifs ("syllables") and sequences ("grammar") to create a comprehensive dictionary of threat avoidance actions, as well as a robust classification system. This research encompasses motion capture (marker-based and marker-less), data curation, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and model implementation and evaluation in Python (scikit-learn). My overarching goal is to leverage artificial intelligence to understand complex human movement patterns and address real-world challenges.
