PhD-educated Data Scientist with 5+ years of research experience applying machine learning, statistical analysis, and Python to extract insights from complex datasets, primarily high-dimensional human motion data. Proven expertise in the end-to-end data science lifecycle: from data acquisition (motion capture, VR) and curation to feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, unsupervised (clustering) and supervised (classification) model development, and evaluation using Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy). Seeking to leverage advanced analytical and ML skills to solve challenging business problems and drive data-informed decisions in a Data Science, ML, or Analytics role.
