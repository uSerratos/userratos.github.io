abstract: Animals including humans must cope with immediate threat and make rapid
  decisions to survive. Without much leeway for cognitive or motor errors, this poses
  a formidable computational problem. Utilizing fully immersive virtual reality with
  13 natural threats, we examined escape decisions in N = 59 humans. We show that
  escape goals are dynamically updated according to environmental changes. The decision
  whether and when to escape depends on time-to-impact, threat identity and predicted
  trajectory, and stable personal characteristics. Its implementation appears to integrate
  secondary goals such as behavioral affordances. Perturbance experiments show that
  the underlying decision algorithm exhibits planning properties and can integrate
  novel actions. In contrast, rapid information-seeking and foraging-suppression are
  only partly devaluation-sensitive. Instead of being instinctive or hardwired stimulus-response
  patterns, human escape decisions integrate multiple variables in a flexible computational
  architecture. Taken together, we provide steps toward a computational model of how
  the human brain rapidly solves survival challenges.
