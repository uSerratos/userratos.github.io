abstract: Animals including humans must cope with immediate threat and make rapid
  decisions between action options to survive. Without much leeway for cognitive or
  motor errors, this poses a formidable computational problem. Utilizing fully-immersive
  virtual reality with 13 natural threats, we examined escape decisions in humans.
  We show that escape goals are dynamically updated according to environmental changes.
  The decision whether and when to escape depends on time-to-impact, threat properties,
  and stable personal characteristics. Its implementation integrates secondary goals
  such as behavioral affordances. Perturbance experiments show that the underlying
  decision algorithm exhibits planning properties and can integrate novel actions,
  in keeping with model-based planning. In contrast, rapid information-seeking and
  foraging-suppression, are initiated based on scalar action values, which adapt over
  time. Our results suggest that instead of being instinctive, stereotypical, or hardwired
  stimulus-response patterns, human escape decisions integrate multiple variables
  in a flexible computational architecture, whereas secondary defensive behaviors
  are controlled by simpler decision mechanisms. Taken together, we provide steps
  towards a computational model of how the human brain rapidly solves survival challenges.
